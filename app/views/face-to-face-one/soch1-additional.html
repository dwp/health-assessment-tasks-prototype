              Lives with two house mates in a standard shared house (this is not supported living accommodation from mental health institutions).

              Access
              She doesn't access all areas of the house steadily as sometimes due to her physical pains she cannot get upstairs to access her bedroom, tending to sleep on the settee downstairs most of the time. Downstairs she is able to walk around all rooms without difficulties. She holds onto the bannisters and the wall for added support if she had to manage stairs whilst taking one 1 step at a time. 

              Aids and appliances
              She self-purchased a walking stick about 2 years ago to provide additional support when walking, which she has to use at all times to be able to walk safely indoors and outdoors. She doesn't use wheelchairs or mobility scooters for outdoors mobility. 

              Bath and shower
              There is a shower over the bath in the bathroom located upstairs. There is a toilet in the same bathroom. Facilities in the bathroom: Grab rails at the side of the bath (pre-installed in the property upon moving in) 

              Occupation
              She is currently unemployed, last worked 2-3 years ago as a website developer on a part- time basis, over 18 hours weekly. She did this job for about 2.5 years prior to leaving. She had to stop from work owing to reasons unrelated to her mental health conditions, but after a short period after terminating work she had a mental health breakdown. 

              Driving
              She holds a full driving licence, she currently drives a manual, unadapted car. The last time she drove was about 2 weeks ago and she drove locally to look after someone else's cat, whereby she drove about a quarter of a mile. She wouldn't be able to drive on longer journeys out of her area if she has to, as she currently feels very overwhelmed and this can cause her to lose concentration. She uses her walking stick and the car door frame for leverage to safely get in and out of the car. 

              Leisure
              She likes spending time in her garden, tending to spend most of her days sitting outside in the garden.

              Shopping
              Her landlady normally does all the grocery shopping for her and then she gets her food delivered at home for ease and convenience purposes. 

              Housework
              She makes up her bed, but her landlady normally does all the housework duties on her behalf, as she's used to it being done this way.

              Pets
              None

              Going out
              She has close friends and family members who she normally interacts with, tending to spend time with them mainly indoors, as she doesn't go out to meet people socially at any point. 

              Use of computers and mobile phones
              She doesn't use computers, emails or the internet regularly, as now using technology is a completely different language to her. She can use her mobile phone to send a text message or ring people if needed.

              Application and consultation
              Questionnaire filled in by claimant herself with help from support worker.
              She arrived to the appointment by a lift from a friend, and she was dropped right in front of the clinic entrance.
