              She is physically capable of putting on and taking off t-shirts, shirts, sweaters and tops independently without difficulties. 
              She tends to find managing zips, fastenings and buttons a bit fiddly due to her hand pains and possibly having swollen fingers. She needs to be sitting down to put on and take off trousers, socks and shoes, for lower half items once sat down she leans forwards to reach down to her feet and lifts her knees closer to her chest in sitting, depending on which position is mostly comfortable.

              She leans forwards and brings knees to chest to put on socks and shoes, which she can manage in this way independently whilst sat down. She normally chooses her own clothes to wear. She can choose clothing in accordance to the weather outside and to the occasion without difficulties.
              
              She ensures that she has clean clothes to wear whenever she washes. She usually changes her clothing as much as possible. 
              It approximately takes her 30 minutes to dress and undress each time, as she likes to take her time not to rush things, especially in the morning if she needs to allow enough time for her joint aches to ease due to joints stiffness. </textarea>

              Restrictions reported: 

              CQ states has problems dressing daily, shoulder is stiff and painful, doesn't have full range of movement, cannot do zips at the back or bras, 5 days out 7 days cannot tie trainers or laces, cannot put arm up to wear a jumper. 

              FH states takes a long time to dress to allow for joint stiffness to ease in the morning, managing buttons can be fiddly due to hand pains, for lower half items once sat down she leans forwards to reach down to her feet and lifts her knees closer to her chest in sitting, depending on which position is mostly comfortable. 

              Recommendation and evidence used to support: 

              It is likely that on the majority of days she can dress and undress unaided reliably. Although CQ and FH indicate certain physical limitations, evidence from HOC shows no ongoing high physical health/musculoskeletal specialists' involvement for her upper limbs/hand grip except for standard GP care if required. 

              HOC shows no current use of prescribed/self-purchased wrist/hand splints to specifically improve upper limb functionality and hand grip. IOs support adequate upper limb functionality and bilateral hand grip, as well as adequate spinal flexibility in a seated position, with MSK exam also supporting adequate upper limb functionality and spinal flexibility required for daily tasks, being noted to perform lower limb standing movements whilst using the walking stick for support. 
              CM section shows partially effective prescribed pain relief medication management. Since sitting down alone is not considered to be an aid in terms of PIP criteria, with overall evidence suggesting adequate upper limb functionality, hand grip and spinal flexibility in a seated and standing position, it is likely she can do this activity unaided. 

              Reasons why the reported restrictions are not supported by evidence: 

              Although she's on maximum dose of Venlafaxine, MSE indicates minimal restrictions on a typical day. 

              Other descriptor supported by some evidence and the reasons why they haven’t been advised:
