              She needs to hold onto the grab rails at the side of the bath to make bathing transfers safely owing to added leverage and stability required due to her physical pains. 

              Normally she has a shower, she sits at the edge of the bath whilst holding onto the grab rails to get in the bath, she then stands in the bath to shower, and whilst standing in the bath she can independently wash her hair, upper body and lower body. 

              Once finished she sits at the edge of the bath and then steps out of the bath whilst holding onto the hand rail. She usually has a wash by the sink on most days, and has a shower once every few days, she is able to determine whenever she needs to have 
              a shower and a wash herself without difficulties, and it approximately takes her 5 minutes to shower each time, which is a normal duration for her. </textarea>

            <textarea class="govuk-textarea govuk-!-margin-bottom-9" id="washingJustification" name="washingJustify" rows="15">
              Restrictions reported: 

              CQ states having a warm bath helps with stiffness and pain in back, legs and shoulder, has difficulty getting out of the bath, only has a bath rarely when there is someone to help her get out, cannot wash her hair due to left shoulder impingement, cannot lift arm up above shoulder height.
              Previous PA4 suggests aided. FH states needs to hold onto grab rails in and out of the bath to make bathing transfers safely due to pain, she usually has a wash by the sink on most days, and has a shower once every few days. 

              Recommendation and evidence used to support: 

              It is likely that on the majority of days she needs to use an aid to be able to wash and bathe reliably. Evidence from HOC shows a diagnosis of OA affecting both knees for which she currently refers to the GP as needed usually whenever due for a medication review, she had PT in the past which was considered to be partially beneficial, she had a left knee arthroscopy in 2018 which was successful in the short term, had steroid injections to the left knee, with the plan in place being that of having more PT sessions and once her left knee musculature is strong and it's deemed she's had enough PT, she would enlist to have a left TKR surgery. 
              FME confirms OA diagnosis, left knee pain and knee giving way, knee pain is aggravated by walking/standing/squatting, also confirming antalgic gait and restless legs. CM section shows partially effective prescribed pain relief medication management.

              SOH shows that she holds onto bannisters and the walls to manage stairs whilst taking 1 step at a time, sometimes she cannot manage stairs due to pain and has to sleep downstairs, uses a self-purchased walking stick constantly, she has pre-installed rails at the side of the bath and uses the walking stick and car door frame for leverage in and out of the car; suggesting certain physical limitations.
              
              IOs support walking at a moderate pace with a slight limp using a walking stick and that she required support moving from sitting to standing and vice versa, whilst demonstrating adequate upper limb functionality, hand grip and spinal flexibility in sitting. MSK exam supports ability to perform lower limb standing movements using a walking stick for added support, also showing adequate spinal movements in sitting and standing.
              Thus overall evidence suggests aids are required due to pain, in line with previous PA4 suggesting the same owing to physical restrictions. 

              Reasons why the reported restrictions are not supported by evidence: 

              Despite HOC reporting fainting episodes during which she loses consciousness, HOC also identifies that she gets a 10 minute warning sign prior to getting fainting episodes which allows her enough time to make herself safe prior to such episodes. 
              CM section shows no currently prescribed medication management for her fainting episodes, suggesting no ongoing neurology specialists' reviews/follow-ups or investigations except for cardiology reviews due to her having an inserted loop recorder. 

              HOC establishes no sustained fainting activity for which she isn't prescribed with any rescue medication. SOH establishes no limitations/restrictions on her driving licence, stating that she is still able to drive if required. 
              Thus it is likely that safety risk imposed around this activity in relation to fainting episodes is relatively minimal. Although she's on maximum dose of Venlafaxine, MSE indicates minimal restrictions on a typical day. 

              Other descriptor supported by some evidence and the reasons why they haven’t been advised: 

              Although CQ indicates assistance to wash her hair and to get in and out of a bath is required, HOC shows no ongoing high physical health/musculoskeletal specialists' involvement for her upper limbs/hand grip except for standard GP care if required. 
              HOC shows no current use of prescribed/self-purchased wrist/hand splints to specifically improve upper limb functionality and hand grip. IOs support adequate upper limb functionality and bilateral hand grip, as well as adequate spinal flexibility in a seated position, with MSK exam also supporting adequate upper limb functionality and spinal flexibility required for daily tasks, being noted to perform lower limb standing movements whilst using the walking stick for support.

              SOH shows that she can hold onto bannisters and the wall to manage stairs and that she can constantly use a walking stick to move around, suggesting adequate upper limb functionality and bilateral hand grip required for daily tasks. SOH also shows that use of hand rails in the bathroom and walking stick is self- purchased and not prescribed. 

              Thus it is likely there is sufficient upper limb functionality and hand grip required to use aids for this activity, since limitations due to physical pains can be likely caused due to OA.
