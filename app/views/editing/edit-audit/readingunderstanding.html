              Restrictions reported: 

              CQ states lines get mixed up and she doesn't remember what she's read, cannot focus. FH states she can read and understand basic and complex written information and sentences without difficulties. 

              Recommendation and evidence used to support: 

              It is likely that on the majority of days she can read and understand basic and complex written information unaided in a timely manner, to an acceptable standard and repeatedly. 

              Although CQ indicates limitations, evidence from HOC shows no underlying diagnoses of learning difficulties/disabilities or any other cognitive/intellectual health related conditions which could potentially indicate restrictions around this activity. 

              SOH shows that she holds a full driving licence, she used to work as a website developer, she knows how to use a mobile phone to text and ring people, stating that the CQ was filled in by herself with help; suggesting adequate cognition and intellect required for daily tasks. This is in line with IOs being unremarkable showing ability to concentrate, to follow a sequence, also confirming good intellect and cognition. 
              MSE also confirms good information processing, insight and cognition. Thus it is likely she can do this activity unaided.
              
              Reasons why the reported restrictions are not supported by evidence: 

              N/A 

              Other descriptor supported by some evidence and the reasons why they haven’t been advised:
