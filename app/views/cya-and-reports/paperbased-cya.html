      Primary Condition: Depression and anxiety

              Diagnosis
              Diagnosed in 2000 (had mental health relapses in 2017, 2020 and 2023) by a community mental health team.
              
              Care and management
              She usually has psychiatry appointments with the mental health team, the last time she had a phone consultation was 4-5 months ago, and she's been under their care since the time of diagnosis.

              She isn't aware as to when she is due to be reviewed again by the psychiatry team, but usually has 4-5 monthly reviews with them. 

              She used to have support worker's input when she used to live at a supported living accommodation, and she stopped this care when she moved to her new address which is not a mental health institution accommodation. 

              She's been on a waiting list to have counselling for a very long time. She currently controls her symptoms with medication management. 

              Symptoms
              Current symptoms she experiences include it is very hard for her to go anywhere, can get very anxious about attending appointments, sometimes feels so low that she doesn't want to get out of bed, doesn't feel motivated to do anything at all, wakes up during the night and is very tired during the day.
              
              Variability
              Daily symptoms she experiences include it is very hard for her to go anywhere, can get very anxious about attending appointments, 
              sometimes feels so low that she doesn't want to get out of bed, doesn't feel motivated to do anything at all, 
              wakes up during the night and is very tired during the day. There is no variation in pattern in terms of symptomatology and every day is described as being the same. 
              
              There are no specific aggravating or alleviating factors to the presenting symptoms as they are consistently felt. 
              The assessment day is a typical day. This is impacting on her ability to prepare food, manage medication and monitor health conditions, and engage with others face to face reliably.

              Progression
              Over the past 12 months these symptoms have been getting worse. 

              Hospital admissions
              Over the past 12 months she last had a hospital admission in December 2020 due to an attempted overdose on medication, and she stayed in hospital for a duration of a day in total for this. 

              Suicidal tendencies
              She's been experiencing suicidal thoughts since the time of her condition diagnosis, she last tried to overdose on medication in December 2020 which required hospitalisation. 
              Currently she still experiences such thoughts, however she wouldn't have intentions or plans to act on the thoughts. 
              
              Whenever feeling very low she engages in self-harming by cutting using knives, sharp objects like scissors and razor blades. She hasn't self-harmed for the past few weeks,
              triggering factors to the self-harming attempts include whenever she feels overwhelmed, and usually self-harms once every few weeks, if she sees sharp objects she still tries her best to combat her thoughts and wouldn't have intentions or plans to act on the self-harming thoughts. 
              
              Her mental health team are fully aware of these intrusive thoughts and attempts, she's had Crisis team and Samaritans involvement in the past, and she is fully aware that if the thoughts get more serious and intrusive she'd immediately seek professional help.

              Secondary condition: Osteoarthritis (OA)
              Osteoarthritis (OA) in both knees and hands, torn rotator cuff in left shoulder, restless legs, benign essential tremor in hands.

              Diagnosis
              Diagnosed in 2005, 2015, 2018 by a neurology specialist in hospital. 

              Care and management
              She currently refers to the GP as and when required for regular monitoring of these conditions, usually whenever she's due for a medication review. 
              She had physiotherapy in 2019 for her knee and left shoulder which was considered to be partially beneficial, she had a left knee arthroscopy in 20 which was successful in the short term, but after a while she sustained a fall and she re-damaged her left knee. 
              
              She had steroid injections to the left knee in February and March 2024 and had 1 left shoulder steroid injection in February 2024, the steroid injections helped with the pain in the short term for a few weeks, however the pain ultimately still persisted.
              The plan in place is to first have a number of PT sessions for the left knee, she is currently awaiting for PT to start in order to strengthen the left knee musculature, and then once she's had enough PT sessions she'd be enlisted to have a left total knee replacement (TKR) surgery. 

              Symptoms
              Current symptoms she experiences include constant bodily aches and pains, left knee is painful all the time, in the morning has to wait for a while to straighten her knees due to stiffness and joints seizing up. 

              Variability
              Daily symptoms she experiences include constant bodily aches and pains, left knee is painful all the time, in the morning has to wait for a while to straighten her knees due to stiffness and joints seizing up. 

              There is no variation in pattern in terms of symptomatology and every day is described as being the same. There are no specific aggravating or alleviating factors to the presenting symptoms as they are consistently felt. 
              The assessment day is a typical day. This is impacting on her ability to prepare food, wash and bathe, manage toilet needs and move around reliably.

              Progression
              Over the past 12 months these symptoms have been getting worse. 

              Hospital admissions
              Over the past 12 months she had no hospital admissions due to this condition.

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Justification for preparing food</h3>
      <p class="text">Restrictions reported: 
    
        CQ states standing for long periods causes knee pains, cutting and peeling causes hand pains and swelling, tremor prevents her from lifting saucepans, cutting, peeling and opening tins, has burnt herself, cannot use a tin opener and has left meals uncooked, a lot of the time feels too exhausted to prepare a meal, spills a lot of things due to tremors, cannot drain vegetables or handle saucepans due to subacromial impingement. 
    
        Previous PA4 suggests aided. FH states poor concentration, forgetfulness, whenever she sees a knife she can get self-harming thoughts, this can be a trigger to engage in self- harming. 
    
        Recommendation and evidence used to support: 
    
        It is likely that on the majority of days she needs supervision to be able to prepare and cook a simple meal reliably. 
        Evidence from HOC shows a diagnosis of anxiety and depression for which she usually has 4-5 monthly psychiatry reviews which have been ongoing since the time of diagnosis of mental health conditions, also indicating that she's currently awaiting to have counselling.
    
        CM section shows partially effective strong dosage of Venlafaxine medication management for her conditions. SOH shows that after terminating work she endured a mental health breakdown episode. FME indicates that anxiety is her main debilitating symptom and she is to be followed up by the mental health team. HOC and MSE establish that whenever feeling very low she engages in self-harming by cutting using knives, sharp objects like scissors and razor blades, she hasn't self-harmed for the past few weeks, triggering factors to the self-harming attempts include whenever she feels overwhelmed, and usually self-harms once every few weeks, if she sees sharp objects she still tries her best to combat her thoughts and wouldn't have intentions or plans to act on the self-harming thoughts. 
    
        Although acknowledging ability to rationalise her way through the thoughts when exposed to sharp objects, considering the nature of her primary health condition as explained in the HOC, it is likely there is an imminent safety risk around using sharp knives and objects in the kitchen due to reported self-harming thoughts and ideation. Thus it is likely supervision is required for this activity. 
    
        Reasons why the reported restrictions are not supported by evidence: 
    
        Despite HOC reporting fainting episodes during which she loses consciousness, HOC also identifies that she gets a 10 minute warning sign prior to getting fainting episodes which allows her enough time to make herself safe prior to such episodes. 
        CM section shows no currently prescribed medication management for her fainting episodes, suggesting no ongoing neurology specialists' reviews/follow-ups or investigations except for cardiology reviews due to her having an inserted loop recorder. 
    
        HOC establishes no sustained fainting activity for which she isn't prescribed with any rescue medication. SOH establishes no limitations/restrictions on her driving licence, stating that she is still able to drive if required. 
        Thus it is likely that safety risk imposed around this activity in relation to fainting episodes is relatively minimal. 
    
        Other descriptor supported by some evidence and the reasons why they haven’t been advised:
    
        Although previous PA4 suggests aided, the following evidence suggests a higher level of restriction. HOC shows a diagnosis of anxiety and depression for which she usually has 4-5 monthly psychiatry reviews which have been ongoing since the time of diagnosis of mental health conditions, also indicating that she's currently awaiting to have counselling. 
    
        CM section shows partially effective strong dosage of Venlafaxine medication management for her conditions, which has been increased in dosage. FME indicates that anxiety is her main debilitating symptom and she is to be followed up by the mental health team. HOC indicates worsening of her primary condition related symptoms over this past year.
    
        HOC and MSE establish a safety risk imposed around sharp objects and knives owing to self-harming thoughts and ideation. Thus it is likely supervision is required due to safety risk around using knives in the kitchen. </p>

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Justification for taking nutrition</h3>
      <p class="text">Restrictions reported: 

        CQ states due to constant shakes cannot lift food with fork, drops food, if she tries to hold a drink in left hand she spills it, cannot hold a fork and knife to eat, it's difficult to cut meat, forgets to eat due to depression and low mood, around 5 days mostly eats snacks, gets anxious missing meals due to diabetes. FH states at times forgets to eat and would need reminding to get herself to eat something, she generally eats foods which require her to only use a fork or a spoon with the right hand for ease and convenience purposes as her left hand might cause tremors, she asks someone else to cut up food in small portions to ensure that she doesn't have to use a fork and knife simultaneously as her left hand can have tremors. 
  
        Recommendation and evidence used to support: 
  
        It is likely that on the majority of days she can take nutrition unaided reliably. Although CQ and FH indicate limitations around having appropriate appetite, evidence from HOC shows no underlying diagnoses of eating disorders, there is no indication of any underlying specialists' input from gastro- enterology, dietitians or nutritionists, in line with CM section showing no currently prescribed dietary or vitamin supplementation medication management. 
  
        IOs support good cognition and intellect. FH implies that upon reminding she's able to get herself to eat something, suggesting that active prompting is not required for the entire duration of this activity. Despite CQ and FH indicating aids are required, HOC shows no ongoing high physical health/musculoskeletal specialists' involvement for her upper limbs/hand grip except for standard GP care if required. 
        HOC shows no current use of prescribed/self- purchased wrist/hand splints to specifically improve upper limb functionality and hand grip. IOs support adequate upper limb functionality and bilateral hand grip, with MSK exam also supporting adequate upper limb functionality required for daily tasks. SOH shows that she can hold onto bannisters and the wall to manage stairs and that she can constantly use a walking stick to move around, suggesting adequate upper limb functionality and bilateral hand grip required for daily tasks. Thus it is likely she can do this activity unaided.

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Justification for washing and bathing</h3>
      <p class="text">Restrictions reported: 

        CQ states having a warm bath helps with stiffness and pain in back, legs and shoulder, has difficulty getting out of the bath, only has a bath rarely when there is someone to help her get out, cannot wash her hair due to left shoulder impingement, cannot lift arm up above shoulder height.
        Previous PA4 suggests aided. FH states needs to hold onto grab rails in and out of the bath to make bathing transfers safely due to pain, she usually has a wash by the sink on most days, and has a shower once every few days. 

        Recommendation and evidence used to support: 

        It is likely that on the majority of days she needs to use an aid to be able to wash and bathe reliably. Evidence from HOC shows a diagnosis of OA affecting both knees for which she currently refers to the GP as needed usually whenever due for a medication review, she had PT in the past which was considered to be partially beneficial, she had a left knee arthroscopy in 2018 which was successful in the short term, had steroid injections to the left knee, with the plan in place being that of having more PT sessions and once her left knee musculature is strong and it's deemed she's had enough PT, she would enlist to have a left TKR surgery. 
        FME confirms OA diagnosis, left knee pain and knee giving way, knee pain is aggravated by walking/standing/squatting, also confirming antalgic gait and restless legs. CM section shows partially effective prescribed pain relief medication management.

        SOH shows that she holds onto bannisters and the walls to manage stairs whilst taking 1 step at a time, sometimes she cannot manage stairs due to pain and has to sleep downstairs, uses a self-purchased walking stick constantly, she has pre-installed rails at the side of the bath and uses the walking stick and car door frame for leverage in and out of the car; suggesting certain physical limitations.
        
        IOs support walking at a moderate pace with a slight limp using a walking stick and that she required support moving from sitting to standing and vice versa, whilst demonstrating adequate upper limb functionality, hand grip and spinal flexibility in sitting. MSK exam supports ability to perform lower limb standing movements using a walking stick for added support, also showing adequate spinal movements in sitting and standing.
        Thus overall evidence suggests aids are required due to pain, in line with previous PA4 suggesting the same owing to physical restrictions. 

        Reasons why the reported restrictions are not supported by evidence: 

        Despite HOC reporting fainting episodes during which she loses consciousness, HOC also identifies that she gets a 10 minute warning sign prior to getting fainting episodes which allows her enough time to make herself safe prior to such episodes. 
        CM section shows no currently prescribed medication management for her fainting episodes, suggesting no ongoing neurology specialists' reviews/follow-ups or investigations except for cardiology reviews due to her having an inserted loop recorder. 

        HOC establishes no sustained fainting activity for which she isn't prescribed with any rescue medication. SOH establishes no limitations/restrictions on her driving licence, stating that she is still able to drive if required. 
        Thus it is likely that safety risk imposed around this activity in relation to fainting episodes is relatively minimal. Although she's on maximum dose of Venlafaxine, MSE indicates minimal restrictions on a typical day. 

        Other descriptor supported by some evidence and the reasons why they haven’t been advised: 

        Although CQ indicates assistance to wash her hair and to get in and out of a bath is required, HOC shows no ongoing high physical health/musculoskeletal specialists' involvement for her upper limbs/hand grip except for standard GP care if required. 
        HOC shows no current use of prescribed/self-purchased wrist/hand splints to specifically improve upper limb functionality and hand grip. IOs support adequate upper limb functionality and bilateral hand grip, as well as adequate spinal flexibility in a seated position, with MSK exam also supporting adequate upper limb functionality and spinal flexibility required for daily tasks, being noted to perform lower limb standing movements whilst using the walking stick for support.

        SOH shows that she can hold onto bannisters and the wall to manage stairs and that she can constantly use a walking stick to move around, suggesting adequate upper limb functionality and bilateral hand grip required for daily tasks. SOH also shows that use of hand rails in the bathroom and walking stick is self- purchased and not prescribed. 

        Thus it is likely there is sufficient upper limb functionality and hand grip required to use aids for this activity, since limitations due to physical pains can be likely caused due to OA. </p>

      <p>(5b) Needs to use an aid or appliance to be able to manage toilet needs or incontinence </p>

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Justification for managing toilet needs</h3>
      <p class="text">Restrictions reported: 

        CQ states gets pain and diarrhea if she has gluten and dairy, has to be close to a toilet and sometimes has accidents before she gets there, it's hard to stand up after sitting on the toilet due to knee pain and stiffness. Previous PA4 suggests aided. 
        FH states difficulties getting to the toilet on time due to knee pains can cause accidents, holds onto the nearby sink and uses the walking stick on and off the toilet for added leverage. 

        Recommendation and evidence used to support: 

        It is likely that on the majority of days she needs to use an aid to be able to manage toilet needs reliably. Evidence from HOC shows a diagnosis of OA affecting both knees for which she currently refers to the GP as needed usually whenever due for a medication review, she had PT in the past which was considered to be partially beneficial, she had a left knee arthroscopy in 2018 which was successful in the short term, had steroid injections to the left knee, with the plan in place being that of having more PT sessions and once her left knee musculature is strong and it's deemed she's had enough PT, she would enlist to have a left TKR surgery. 
        FME confirms OA diagnosis, left knee pain and knee giving way, knee pain is aggravated by walking/standing/squatting, also confirming antalgic gait and restless legs. CM section shows partially effective prescribed pain relief medication management. 

        SOH shows that she holds onto bannisters and the walls to manage stairs whilst taking 1 step at a time, sometimes she cannot manage stairs due to pain and has to sleep downstairs, uses a self-purchased walking stick constantly, she has pre-installed rails at the side of the bath and uses the walking stick and car door frame for leverage in and out of the car; suggesting certain physical limitations.
        
        IOs support walking at a moderate pace with a slight limp using a walking stick and that she required support moving from sitting to standing and vice versa, whilst demonstrating adequate upper limb functionality and hand grip. MSK exam supports ability to perform lower limb standing movements using a walking stick for added support. This is in line with FH indicating the need to use a walking stick and to hold onto a sink when getting on and off the toilet. 
        Thus overall evidence suggests aids are required due to pain, in line with previous PA4 suggesting the same owing to physical restrictions. 

        Reasons why the reported restrictions are not supported by evidence: 

        Despite CQ and FH indicating physical difficulties with reaching the toilet on time can cause accidents, the physical ability to reach the toilet is not considered within the scope of this activity, since moving around is only considered under the scope of activity 12. 

        Moreover, HOC shows no underlying diagnoses of urinary/bowel incontinence related issues which could potentially cause restrictions due to bladder/bowel incontinence related accidents.

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Justification for managing dressing and undressing</h3>
      <p class="text">Restrictions reported: 

        CQ states has problems dressing daily, shoulder is stiff and painful, doesn't have full range of movement, cannot do zips at the back or bras, 5 days out 7 days cannot tie trainers or laces, cannot put arm up to wear a jumper. 

        FH states takes a long time to dress to allow for joint stiffness to ease in the morning, managing buttons can be fiddly due to hand pains, for lower half items once sat down she leans forwards to reach down to her feet and lifts her knees closer to her chest in sitting, depending on which position is mostly comfortable. 

        Recommendation and evidence used to support: 

        It is likely that on the majority of days she can dress and undress unaided reliably. Although CQ and FH indicate certain physical limitations, evidence from HOC shows no ongoing high physical health/musculoskeletal specialists' involvement for her upper limbs/hand grip except for standard GP care if required. 

        HOC shows no current use of prescribed/self-purchased wrist/hand splints to specifically improve upper limb functionality and hand grip. IOs support adequate upper limb functionality and bilateral hand grip, as well as adequate spinal flexibility in a seated position, with MSK exam also supporting adequate upper limb functionality and spinal flexibility required for daily tasks, being noted to perform lower limb standing movements whilst using the walking stick for support. 
        CM section shows partially effective prescribed pain relief medication management. Since sitting down alone is not considered to be an aid in terms of PIP criteria, with overall evidence suggesting adequate upper limb functionality, hand grip and spinal flexibility in a seated and standing position, it is likely she can do this activity unaided. 

        Reasons why the reported restrictions are not supported by evidence: 

        Although she's on maximum dose of Venlafaxine, MSE indicates minimal restrictions on a typical day.

        FH states she does not express any significant issues with verbal communication, speaking and hearing.

        It is likely that on the majority of days she can express and understand verbal information unaided in a timely manner, to an acceptable standard and repeatedly.

        Previous PA4 suggests unaided. FH states needs notification and a friend or relative to be with her when meeting a new person, without this help she'd cancel the meeting until help is provided due to anxiety, she doesn't interact with people she doesn't know as she can feel uncomfortable and overwhelmed due to mental health reasons.

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Justification for planning and following journeys</h3>
      <p class="text">Restrictions reported: 

        CQ states gets frightened about having a panic attack at the thought of leaving the house, asks husband or relatives to do the shopping, is usually fine in known places but if the route changes or she gets lost gets extremely anxious, panicky, cannot breathe and feels sick, is not comfortable approaching anyone for directions, cannot follow a map if anxious, gets distressed about missing a turn, usually doesn't go to new places due to anxiety. FH states she usually gets a lift to attend for appointments, as she's used to it being done this way. 

        Recommendation and evidence used to support: 

        It is likely that on the majority of days she can plan and follow the route of a journey unaided reliably. Although acknowledging regular psychiatry reviews and prescribed strong medication dosage for her mental health conditions, evidence from HOC shows no underlying diagnoses of agoraphobia, learning difficulties/disabilities or other cognitive/intellectual health related conditions which could potentially cause restrictions around this activity. 

        Despite CQ reporting limitations, CM section shows no currently prescribed anxiolytic medication management which is required specifically for when embarking on a journey, also showing partially effective prescribed Venlafaxine for her conditions. SOH shows that she's able to drive on short journeys. 
        Moreover, FH implies that rather than active intervention it is more of a level of reassurance which is required for her to reliably undertake this activity, also showing adaptability to dealing with panic attacks in her own ways and means, and that she'd still be able to function in a safe and acceptable manner if she gets lost on her own. 

        This is in line with IOs being unremarkable showing good orientation to time, place and person, ability to concentrate, to follow a sequence, to take decisions independently, also showing good insight, intellect, cognition and memory skills. MSE confirms a calm and relaxed behaviour, good insight, cognition and information processing. Thus it is likely the high threshold of OPD isn't met and that she can reliably plan and follow journeys unaided. 

        Reasons why the reported restrictions are not supported by evidence: 

        Despite HOC reporting fainting episodes during which she loses consciousness, HOC also identifies that she gets a 10 minute warning sign prior to getting fainting episodes which allows her enough time to make herself safe prior to such episodes, reporting that she's never fainted when she was outdoors as if she feels the lightheadedness she doesn't go out at all. 

        CM section shows no currently prescribed medication management for her fainting episodes, suggesting no ongoing neurology specialists' reviews/follow-ups or investigations except for cardiology reviews due to her having an inserted loop recorder. HOC establishes no sustained fainting activity for which she isn't prescribed with any rescue medication. SOH establishes no limitations/restrictions on her driving licence, stating that she is still able to drive if required. 
        Thus it is likely that safety risk imposed around this activity in relation to fainting episodes is relatively minimal.

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Justification for moving around</h3>
      <p class="text">Restrictions reported:

        CQ states less than 20 metres, has knee stiffness, pain, inflammation and instability moving from sitting to standing, uses walking stick and knee brace with metal hinges and without these she cannot walk, it's painful going up and down stairs due to pain and weakness, walks quite slowly as left knee is unstable and gives way, has fallen quite a lot recently. Previous PA4 suggests 50-200 metres. 
        FH states 30 metres take 5 minutes to cover, she then stops for a 5 minute rest break due to knee pains, and can then repeat this same distance as tolerated prior to exhaustion but sometimes due to pain she wouldn't be able to repeat this distance. 

        Recommendation and evidence used to support:
        
        It is likely that on the majority of days she can stand and then move using an aid more than 20 metres but no more than 50 metres, reliably. HOC shows a diagnosis of OA affecting both knees for which she currently refers to the GP as needed usually whenever due for a medication review, she had PT in the past which was considered to be partially beneficial, she had a left knee arthroscopy in 2018 which was successful in the short term, had steroid injections to the left knee, with the plan in place being that of having more PT sessions and once her left knee musculature is strong and it's deemed she's had enough PT, she would enlist to have a left TKR surgery. 

        FME confirms OA diagnosis, left knee pain and knee giving way, knee pain is aggravated by walking/standing/squatting, also confirming antalgic gait and restless legs. CM section shows partially effective prescribed pain relief medication management. SOH shows that she holds onto bannisters and the walls to manage stairs whilst taking 1 step at a time, sometimes she cannot manage stairs due to pain and has to sleep downstairs, uses a self-purchased walking stick constantly; suggesting certain physical limitations. IOs support walking at a moderate pace with a slight limp using a walking stick whilst being noted to grimace due to pain and that she required support moving from sitting to standing and vice versa. 

        MSK exam supports ability to perform lower limb standing movements using a walking stick for added support. FH indicates ability to walk up to 30 metres prior to stopping due to knee pains. With overall evidence suggesting that she's awaiting for further specialists' interventions for the left knee, she was noted to walk at a moderate pace with a slight limp using her walking stick, FME supports she walks with an antalgic gait, and SOH indicates she can access rooms downstairs however she cannot always manage stairs due to pain; it is likely she can stand and walk 20-50 metres aided reliably.

        N/A 

        Other descriptor supported by some evidence and the reasons why they haven’t been advised: 

        Although previous PA4 suggests 50-200 metres, the following evidence indicates a decline due to physical health symptoms. IOs show that she was observed to walk for approximately 5 metres in 7 seconds at a moderate pace, being noticed to slightly limp onto the left leg with every step she takes, also being noticed to grimace with pain whilst taking 1 step at a time walking with a walking stick held on the right hand side and she was observed to sit to stand and stand to sit in 1 fluid movement by holding onto the sides of the chair for added support and stability due to her physical pains to make both transfers as smoothly as possible. 

        MSK exam shows that she required the support of a walking stick to perform lower limb standing movements. HOC establishes that she's awaiting for further specialists' input due to her left knee. FME confirms OA diagnosis, left knee pain and knee giving way, knee pain is aggravated by walking/standing/squatting, also confirming antalgic gait and restless legs. CM section shows partially effective prescribed pain relief medication management. SOH shows that she has to use a walking stick constantly to walk and at times she wouldn't be able to manage stairs due to pain, having to sleep downstairs, however is able to access rooms downstairs in the property. Thus overall evidence indicates a decline due to OA diagnosis, and that she can reliably walk 20-50 metres aided reliably.

     <p class="text">Behaviour
      She managed to maintain a calm and relaxed behaviour whilst managing to establish an appropriate rapport with the assessor. She was keen on participating and was happy to provide elaborate answers to the questions asked.

      Mood
      Her mood appeared to be stable and euthymic throughout. Initially she appeared to be tearful when explaining about details in relation to her health conditions, however this sensation quickly resolved as the assessment proceeded, once she felt more at ease opening up about her health conditions.

      Suicidal thoughts
      She's been experiencing suicidal thoughts since the time of her mental health condition diagnosis, she last tried to overdose on medication in December 2020 which required hospitalisation. Currently she still experiences such thoughts, however she wouldn't have intentions or plans to act on the thoughts. 
      Her mental health team are aware of these thoughts and past suicidal attempt.

      Self-harm thoughts
      Whenever feeling very low she engages in self-harming by cutting using knives, sharp objects like scissors and razor blades. She hasn't self-harmed for the past few weeks, triggering factors to the self-harming attempts include whenever she feels overwhelmed, and usually self-harms once every few weeks, if she sees sharp objects she still tries her best to combat her thoughts and wouldn't have intentions or plans to act on the self-harming thoughts. 
      Her mental health team are aware of these thoughts and attempts.

      Speech
      Her speech was normal in tone, rate, flow, volume and content, being capable of clear, comprehensible speech and of speaking in full, coherent sentences during the assessment.

       No questions were requested to be simplified or reworded as she was able to understand questions asked and to explain elaborate details about things being discussed without difficulties, demonstrating good information processing.

       Cognition
       She was able to follow questions and give appropriate answers in a timely manner.

       Insight
       She acknowledged diagnosis, able to identify impact of condition.

            Certain functional limitations were present at the time of the assessment, which would warrant a review. She is currently on the waiting list to have counselling. She is due to start having PT sessions for the left knee, and once she would have had enough sessions she's to enlist for a left TKR surgery. Since there are pending specialists' interventions in place with no official confirmatory appointment start date, the reported symptoms are likely to have a functional impact on her ability to carry out daily living and mobility tasks reliably in the short term. With further specialists' interventions in place, a short term review of 1 year 6 months is most appropriate.
