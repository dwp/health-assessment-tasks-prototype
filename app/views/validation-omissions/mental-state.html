      She managed to maintain a calm and relaxed behaviour whilst managing to establish an appropriate rapport with the assessor. She was keen on participating and was happy to provide elaborate answers to the questions asked.

      Mood
      Her mood appeared to be stable and euthymic throughout. Initially she appeared to be tearful when explaining about details in relation to her health conditions, however this sensation quickly resolved as the assessment proceeded, once she felt more at ease opening up about her health conditions.

      Suicidal thoughts
      She's been experiencing suicidal thoughts since the time of her mental health condition diagnosis, she last tried to overdose on medication in December 2020 which required hospitalisation. Currently she still experiences such thoughts, however she wouldn't have intentions or plans to act on the thoughts. 
      Her mental health team are aware of these thoughts and past suicidal attempt.</textarea>
