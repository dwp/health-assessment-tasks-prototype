              However she generally eats foods which require her to only use a fork or a spoon with the right hand for ease and convenience purposes as her left hand might cause tremors. 
      
              She asks someone else to cut up food in small portions to ensure that she doesn't have to use a fork and knife simultaneously as her left hand can have tremors.
               She is able to acknowledge herself whenever she's hungry, but there are times when she forgets to eat due to her mental health conditions. 
      
               She'd need to be reminded to eat regularly, and once reminded she'd get herself to eat something. She normally eats 1 main meal daily, tending to snack on fruit throughout the day when she feels like. </textarea>
